			<h3>Don't Look</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-11-3">Made: 11/3/19</time>
			<p>Designed all code for a weekend production of a first-person horror game in 3D Unity. Structured code to implement game state changes based on forward, right, and other side vectors implemented with trigonometric math. There is a safe zone with slight grey fog, a danger zone with red fog, and then a death zone with thick black fog indicating the player has lost a life. If the player loses all 3, there is a jumpscare with camera rotation focusing on the entity. 2 person team project: myself as the developer and my friend as the artist.</p>

			<h3>Teemin' Demon Beatin' Season</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-11-1">Made: 11/01/19</time>
			<p>A 2D Unity C# project. Designed main grid for core mechanic. Implemented sprite transitions for paths/enemies/attacks. Structured meetings based on project scope and sprints. The player drags lines of a path onto a grid to guide enemy demons around towers that will attack them within a certain range. The goal is to prevent any demons from surviving long enough to attack the city walls. If the player successfully kills enough demons to protect the city walls, the player wins the stage. The less damage inflicted on the walls, the more stars the player wins. The stages grow more difficult. The game ends when all the stages are cleared.

			<h3>The Black Dagger</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-09-27">Made: 09/27/19</time>
			<p>I was the team lead, making sure that assignments were done on time, as well as keeping the project in-scope of the timeframe alloted. The Black Dagger is fantasy themed turn-based game set in the world of Ethshar.  In this game, one player takes control of an assassin who has successfully cast the black dagger spell.  They then try to kill priority targets scattered in the corners of the city.  However, there are four magical guards, which are controlled by the other players, that have been assigned the task of taking down the assassin.  Take control of the assassin, sneaking through hidden tunnel systems trying to kill all of your targets, or take the job of the magical guards and try and stop the assassin!</p>

			<h3>Blok</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-12-12">Made: 12/12/18</time>
			<p>Blok was made using a matrix of cells set up through javascript. It was an independent academic project. If a row or column is filled with active cells, it clears that specific row or column.

			<h3>Geometry Bash</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-04-29">Made: 04/29/18</time>
			<p>As the production manager, all deadline were met accordingly and efficiently. I worked heavily on setting up the UI as well as level loading from a text file. Geometry Bash is a sci-fi themed 2-player fighting game in which players play as one of three different shapes with different abilities for attacks. Levels can be chosen in a level selection screen, and edited very easily from the text file.</p>

			<h3>Differentiation Calculator</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-04-29">Made: 04/29/18</time>
			<p>Implemented a calculator that uses a math API to perform derivatives and integrals. Coded all of the javascript while my team member did the css. To view webpage, click <a href="https://people.rit.edu/kjm7088/230/project2/newtonCalculator.html">HERE</a></p>

			<h3>Asteroids</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-04-29">Made: 04/29/18</time>
			<p>First real independent project made in Unity. Coded bounding boxes that then used AABB collision detection. Score UI and script tracks values that when upgraded, feed new values and updates into the other scripts including speed multiplier, sprites, and bullet behavior.</p>

			<h3>Chem Dash</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-04-29">Made: 04/29/18</time>
			<p>During a 24hr time frame to finish the game, I grouped up with 2 first-time game jammers to show them the ropes. Heard their ideas and then gave advice and tweaks to keep the project in scope for the timeframe alloted. Personally, I implemented the click and drag interface for items as well as info feeding between scripts when required. Helped team members know what chemical formulas to use as well to keep the game simple. To visit the page and/or download, click <a href="https://itch.io/jam/jam-for-a-cause/rate/517882">HERE</a></p>
